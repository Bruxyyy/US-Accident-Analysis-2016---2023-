# US-Accident-Analysis-2016---2023-
US Accident Analysis (2016 - 2023)
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the US Accident dataset (available on Kaggle). The dataset contains detailed records of accidents across the United States, excluding data from New York. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights that could help in understanding accident trends and potentially improving road safety.

Key Features of the Analysis:
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Loaded the dataset and handled missing values.
Identified numerical and categorical columns for analysis.
Exploratory Analysis and Visualizations:

City Analysis: Explored accident distribution across cities, highlighting high-accident zones.
Temporal Analysis:
Accident trends by time of day, day of the week, and month.
Differences between weekdays and weekends.
Spatial Analysis:
Visualized accident locations using scatter plots and heatmaps.
Weather Analysis:
Investigated the impact of weather conditions on accidents.
Insights:

Peak accident times: Morning rush hours (6–10 AM) and evening hours (3–6 PM).
On Sundays, accidents peak between 10 AM and 3 PM.
Most accidents are concentrated in a few cities, with an exponential drop-off in others.
Notable absence of data from New York City.
Visualization Tools:

Seaborn and Matplotlib for statistical visualizations.
Folium for creating interactive maps and heatmaps.
Objectives:
Identify temporal and spatial patterns in accident occurrences.
Highlight cities and times with higher accident frequencies.
Explore potential relationships between weather and accident rates.
Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium.
Dataset: US Accidents Dataset (Kaggle).
Conclusion:
This project provides a foundational analysis of US accidents, with actionable insights for road safety improvements. Future work could include predictive modeling or integrating additional datasets for deeper insights.
